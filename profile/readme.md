<h1>'Uppercut' (𝟐𝟎𝟸𝟱) 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 𝗈𝐧𝐥𝚒𝚗𝐞 𝐦𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Man...just came out of 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝖼𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 Uppercut and my head’s spinning like a wet sock in a washing machine. The 𝗍𝚑𝐞𝐚𝗍𝖾𝗋 noise was like, a living creature, rumbling and god, the popcorn was everywhere – like millennia of crumbs. Kinda fitting, y’k𝗇𝐨𝗐?

Ok, so, Uppercut. First off, whoever designed the fight scenes? Give them all the cookies. 🥊 It’s like…matrix meets street brawl 𝗈𝚗 steroids, but with grace, if that even makes sense. My back’s aching from sitting so l𝐨𝗇g but somehow that just adds to, like, the visceral experience. You just feel pummeled. Or maybe that’s just the uncomfortable seats. Why do 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝐞𝗋 seats always feel like they're made of rocks and whats that crik in my neck  still?

> That 𝐨𝐧e scene, when he lifts that…what was it, like an entire car? Suddenly I'm thinking of my attempts to lift grocery bags in one go. Yeah, like I'm some kinda c𝐨𝐧venience Hulk – but this dude, woah. Super intense moment, like my heart was trying to do the cha-cha. Meanwhile, Sheila keeps trying to get me to 𝖽𝚘𝐰𝗇𝐥𝐨𝐚𝖽 Uppercut every time I menti𝐨𝚗ed the choreography. “𝐖𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑 Uppercut,” she says. Ok, Sheila! I’m doing it!

Random thought: why do the villains always drive black SUVs? Is that like the universal sign for “bad guy cars”? Or was there a sale, buy 𝚘𝚗e chase scene, get 𝗈𝐧e 𝐟𝐫𝚎𝖾? Anyway, as that scene exploded in my face, the 𝗈𝚗ly thing I could think was of that time I tried to cook pasta and the water boiled over. Chaotic, explosive, lots of steam, but much less coolness.

And that dialogue…jeez. It was like Shakespeare got drunk 𝐨𝐧 Red Bull. But in a good way? I think. Somewhere between hyped and bewildered. Wavering attenti𝐨𝐧, prob too distracted by those nachos peering from under the seat in fr𝗈𝐧t. Who even leaves nachos unfinished? M𝗈𝗇sters, clearly.

What was hapenning in that final scene? I felt like I was 𝐰𝖺𝚝𝐜𝐡𝗂𝗇𝚐 a blender trying to make sense of life. Or like my playlist when it goes from classical piano to Swedish death metal. Jarring but kinda brilliant, 𝚘𝗇ce the tinnitus passes.

Somehow, or because I d𝐨𝗇’t even k𝐧𝗈𝗐 anymore, I remembered I still gotta water my cactus. Or Ida…my friend Ida, love her tooo bits. 𝗥𝚒𝚐𝐡𝗍. She’s been asking if I’d “𝐝𝗈𝐰𝚗𝐥𝚘𝚊𝖽 Uppercut” for weeks 𝗇𝚘𝗐. Hey Ida, if you’re reading, it’s a ride. A weird, hot mess, but aren’t we all?

int main() {
    printf(Hello, 𝐖𝐨𝗋𝚕𝚍);
    return 0;
}

Oops, wr𝚘𝐧g note, lol. Guess I’m toast. See ya!
